This repository contains all the coursework for [`Effect: Beginners Complete Getting Started`](https://www.typeonce.dev/course/effect-beginners-complete-getting-started).

The app is implemented using typescript. You can get started by forking/cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```

The project follows the implementation of the app in the course:
- Entry point inside [index.ts](./src/index.ts)
- All *Pascal Case* files in [src](./src/) are effect services
- Testing inside [test](./test/)
